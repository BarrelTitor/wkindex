  "description": "This (unofficial) app for Android is a supplemental tool to aid in fast recognition of terms and vocabulary.  The time to choose the correct answer for a given card gets progressively shorter for continuous correct streaks. CAUTION: You should be careful with using this tool as it will interfere with the concept of learning by Spaced Repetition. I'd only advise using it for Burned items, even though you can select lower levels."
