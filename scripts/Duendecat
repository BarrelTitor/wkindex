  "description": "One of the things that I've found difficult while using Wanikani has been keeping burned words/kanji fresh in my memory whenever I'm too busy/distracted to sit down and do some real hardcore studying, which I've discovered can be achieved (with the least amount of effort) by keeping a list of short sentences nearby and then incorporating those into some kind of continuous 24/7 "total immersion" environment. So in November last year I started working on a simple slideshow app that could be left running permanently on a dedicated computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi) which would cycle randomly through sentences in Japanese that contain kanji that I've studied.  This eventually resulted in a more ambitious web app called Duendecat that contains tens of thousands of sentences from the updated version of the Tanaka corpus, which are grouped into Wanikani levels 1-50"
