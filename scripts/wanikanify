  "description": "Wanikanify takes the vocabulary you've studied, finds the english word on a webpage and substitutes the kanji character. As you learn more kanji, your webpages begin to fill up with kanji! Wanikanify can find word anywhere on a webpage and replace it for kanji characters. It is a great utility for practicing and recalling vocabulary you may have forgotten. "
